# These are our examples for Antares

## AntLogo.c
- A simple example to show a logo for Antares using built in font and some graphical primitives
## PNG.c
- This example simply loads a .png image from either PC (using Plan9) or uSD into EVE's RAM and then displays it.
- Loading a large image over Plan9 can take several seconds
## Fonts.c
- This example shows how to use fonts built with the EVE Asset Builder
- The two font files are loaded from either PC (using Plan9) or uSD into EVE's RAM
- This shows the hard way to use these kind of assets.  Either the Antares asset builder or the Gameduino asset builder can make it easier.
